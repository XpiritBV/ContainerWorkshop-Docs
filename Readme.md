# Workshop 'Doing Docker DevOps Style'

Welcome to the workshop "Doing Docker DevOps Style". 

In this workshop you will create a .NET application that demonstrates what is required to design a solution running in a Docker ecosystem. It caters to people with or without prior experience using containers.

To get the best experience with the hands-on-labs it is recommended that you prepare the following ahead of time:

- A laptop for development, capable of running containers.
- A recent version of Visual Studio Code ([download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- Docker Desktop, on Windows or Mac ([download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- An Azure subscription, to create and use a container cluster and registry ([trial account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)).
- For [Lab 8 - Azure DevOps pipelines](Lab8-AzDOPipelines.md), you'll need an Azure DevOps subscription. Get one for free here: [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com).

### Preparing for workshop

Even though you can certainly participate in this workshop with an unprepared laptop, it will save a lot of time to install your development machine ahead of time. In [Lab 1 - Getting started](Lab1-GettingStarted.md) you will find a list of the recommended tools to install on your laptop or development Virtual Machine.

Additionally, for hosting a container cluster in Microsoft Azure you will need an Azure subscription. You can create a trial account if you do not have a subscription available.
